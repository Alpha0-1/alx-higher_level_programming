If-Else Statements:
In programming, if-else statements are used for decision-making. The syntax is straightforward, with a condition followed by code to execute if the condition is true and code to execute if it's false.

While Loop:
A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. The loop continues until the condition becomes false.

For Loop (Python vs. C):
In Python, the for loop is simpler compared to C. Python's for loop automatically iterates over the items of an iterable, whereas in C, it requires explicit initialization, condition, and increment/decrement statements.

Keywords:

break: Used to exit a loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.
else: In loops, the else block is executed when the loop condition becomes false.
pass: Acts as a placeholder, doing nothing and often used when a statement is required syntactically but no action is desired.
range: In Python, range is a function generating a sequence of numbers, commonly used in for loops.
