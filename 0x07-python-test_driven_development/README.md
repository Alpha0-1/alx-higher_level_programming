Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing code. In the context of Python, TDD involves the following steps:

Write a Test: Start by writing a test that defines the expected behavior of the code you're going to write. This test should typically fail initially since the code being tested hasn't been implemented yet.

Write the Code: Implement the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass. This means writing the functionality that satisfies the conditions outlined in the test.

Run the Tests: Execute all tests, including the new one you just wrote, to ensure that the newly written code works as expected and hasn't broken any existing functionality.

Refactor (Optional): Once all tests pass, you may refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, or performance. However, the behavior of the code should remain the same as defined by the tests.

Repeat: Continue this cycle, writing new tests, implementing code, and running tests until all desired features are implemented and all tests pass.
