0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
In Python, classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. Objects are instances of classes, representing specific entities with their own unique data.

Key concepts:

Class: A class is a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods common to all objects of that type.

Object: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own unique data.

Attributes: Attributes are variables that belong to objects or classes. They store data associated with the object or class.

Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class. They define the behavior of objects of that class.

Instance: An instance is a specific realization of a class. It is created using the class constructor and represents a unique object with its own data.

Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It hides the internal implementation details of the class from the outside world.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in code by allowing methods to operate on objects of different types.

Class Variables: Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are accessed using the class name rather than through instances of the class.

Instance Variables: Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They store data specific to each object and are accessed using the instance name.

Constructor: The constructor is a special method in Python (named __init__) that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object's state and can accept arguments to set initial values for attributes.

These concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, enabling the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
