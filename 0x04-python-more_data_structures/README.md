Sets:
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements in Python. It is defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor. Sets support various mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Sets are mutable, allowing elements to be added or removed.

Key characteristics:

Unordered: Elements are not stored in a specific order.
Unique: Each element in a set must be unique.
Mutable: Elements can be added or removed after the set is created.
Common set operations:

union(): Returns the union of two sets.
intersection(): Returns the intersection of two sets.
difference(): Returns the difference between two sets.
symmetric-difference(): Returns the symmetric difference between two sets.
Dictionaries:
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python. Each key must be unique, and it is associated with a specific value. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}, and values can be accessed using their corresponding keys. Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for the addition, modification, or deletion of key-value pairs.

Key characteristics:

Unordered: Key-value pairs are not stored in a specific order.
Key-Value pairs: Each element in a dictionary consists of a key and its corresponding value.
Mutable: Key-value pairs can be added, modified, or removed after the dictionary is created.
Common dictionary operations:

Accessing values: Values can be accessed using their keys.
keys(): Returns a view of all keys in the dictionary.
values(): Returns a view of all values in the dictionary.
items(): Returns a view of all key-value pairs in the dictionary.
Both sets and dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python, serving different purposes based on the requirements of the program.
